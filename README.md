Voice Assistant
----------------------

This README file provides an overview of the Voice Assistant project developed by the ML team of IoT Labs KIIT. It explains the purpose of the project, the features it offers, and the necessary dependencies to run the code.

### Project Overview

The voice assistant project aims to create a simple voice-controlled assistant that can perform tasks such as answering questions, providing the current time and date, and controlling IoT devices like lights. The assistant utilizes various technologies such as speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, web scraping, and OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.

### Dependencies

To run the code for this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

-   Python (version 3.6 or later)
-   requests
-   beautifulsoup4
-   pyttsx3
-   speech_recognition
-   openai

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip, the package installer for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following command

`pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pyttsx3 speechrecognition openai`

### Usage

To use the voice assistant, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the project repository or obtain the source code files through any other means.

2.  Open the Python script (e.g., `version1.5.py`) in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

3.  Make sure you have an API key from OpenAI. Replace the placeholder `'YOUR-KEY-HERE'` with your actual API key in the script.

4.  Save the modified script.

5.  Run the script using the following command:

    `python version1.5.py`

6.  The voice assistant will start listening for voice commands. You can interact with it by speaking out commands such as "switch on the lights," "switch off the lights," "time now," or "date today."

7.  The voice assistant will process your command and provide the corresponding response, such as turning the lights on/off or providing the current time or date.


Thank you for using the Voice Assistant project!
